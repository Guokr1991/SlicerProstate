This is work in progress, not yet ready for public use. No documentation is available yet.

This repository contains a collection of tools to facilitate prostate cancer image-guided therapy applications. 

The specific applications of interest include annotation and analysis of multi-parametric MRI, registration across different modalities for image-guided navigation.

ProstateIGT will be available to the users as an extension of 3D Slicer (http://slicer.org).
